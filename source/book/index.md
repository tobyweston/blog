This book is for Java developers looking to transition to programming Scala. It helps translate what you already know in Java to Scala and kick starts your functional programming journey.

The book takes a tour of Scala to get you up and running then compares Java syntax directly to Scala to give you a quick start translating one-to-one. It goes on to describe Scala specific features including monads and for-comprehensions. The book wraps up with some general advice adopting Scala in Java teams.

It's around 230 pages (39,000 words).
