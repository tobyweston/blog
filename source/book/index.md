Essential Acceptance Testing questions the conventional acceptance testing techniques used by many teams today. Itâ€™s a Lean publishing effort. I regularly publish new chapters and listen to my readers. It's only short, something like 15,000-20,000 words.

> Have traditional agile testing techniques become testing dogma? Have we adopted a cargo cult of testing? Do these techniques really help build great products? Do they help us get from concept to cash or are they holding us back?

## Lean Publishing

In keeping with lean publishing principles, it's currently an in-progress subset of the complete book. I hope that readers will debate, ask questions and help steer the direction. If there's no interest, that's great too. Failing fast is always a better than failing slowly.

The beta reading period is now closed but you can still bag a copy over at <a href="https://leanpub.com/essential_acceptance_testing" onClick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links', 'leanpub.com'); return false;">Leanpub</a> or <a href="http://samples.leanpub.com/essential_acceptance_testing-sample.pdf" onClick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links', 'leanpub.com'); return false;">download the free sample chapters</a>.
