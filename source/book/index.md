I'm looking for beta readers to help with my book <a href="https://leanpub.com/essential_acceptance_testing" onClick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links', 'leanpub.com'); return false;">Essential Acceptance Testing</a>. It's only short, probably around 15,000-20,000 words. It discusses the generally accepted testing strategies used in agile circles and critiques what has become the "norm".


## Lean Publishing

It's a lean publishing effort. If there's no interest, I won't waste my time writing something nobody wants. What I really want though is to engage potential readers and encourage them to feedback, here or at <a href="https://leanpub.com/essential_acceptance_testing" onClick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links', 'leanpub.com'); return false;">Leanpub</a>. So if you don't mind reading it as it's being written, bag a copy at <a href="https://leanpub.com/essential_acceptance_testing" onClick="trackOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links', 'leanpub.com'); return false;">Leanpub</a>.
