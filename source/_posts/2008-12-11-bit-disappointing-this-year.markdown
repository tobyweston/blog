Bit disappointing really. Things didn't get started properly will around 12:00 on day 1. I got to attend two really interesting talks of ~30 minutes each but then got trapped in a couple of nightmarish 'Open Spaces' which ended up being a rather self-indulgent discussions about nothing in particular.
