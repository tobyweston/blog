I recently created a free place online to collect training materials and videos around eXtreme Programming. I'm creating or curating a set of live workshops, check it out at [https://xpdojo.org](https://xpdojo.org).

The first video on the site gives an introduction to refactoring and some examples in Java from chapter 1 of [Martin Fowler's book](https://amzn.to/31rSy4U). The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/tobyweston/Refactoring-Chapter-1).
