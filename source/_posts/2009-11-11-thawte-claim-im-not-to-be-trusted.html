...well, not quite, but they have recently announced that they'd be discontinuing the Personal E-mail Certificates and Web of Trust. These were free services and it comes as bit of a blow as I've been using them to sign my JARs for WebStart deployment. As Thawte are the root authority, it meant no annoying prompts from WebStart claiming I was a would-be terrorist. Looks like I'm back to hiding in shadows.<br /><br />A couple of useful links below.<br /><br /><a href="http://ciardhubh.de/node/4">http://ciardhubh.de/node/4</a><br /><a href="http://www.dallaway.com/acad/webstart/">http://www.dallaway.com/acad/webstart/</a><br /><br /><div><br /><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-uMxV_fCbC4/SVInGoVdYJI/AAAAAAAAC08/I4RV1KzCyPo/s320/gibble_22x22.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5283328307719135378" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 22px; height: 22px;" border="0" /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20485368-1004424815510660026?l=pequenoperro.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
