The Adafruit Console Lead uses the [PL2303TA](http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?pcid=41) (a USB-to-serial/parallel converter chip) to talk to the Pi over GPIO pins 8 and 10 via USB. You can use this kind of USB to serial communication on plenty of devices but with the Pi, it's handy to use the `screen` application to effectively open a terminal to your Pi.

Most of the guides on the internet point you to older versions of the drivers, but to get things working on the Mac with El Capitan, I've found [v1.6 of the Prolific driver](http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=229&pcid=41) is the only working option.


It's not hard to build you're own cable from the basic components or you could try [eBay for parts for under Â£2/$2](http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.XPL2303TA.TRS0&_nkw=PL2303TA&_sacat=0) but I can't say if they use genuine Prolific chips or counterfeit.


## Create a Screen

    $ ls -la /dev/tty.usb*
    crw-rw-rw-  1 root  wheel   17,   4 28 Dec 19:49 /dev/tty.usbserial

Startup screen and point it to your Pi (`115200` is the baud rate to communicate with).

    screen /dev/tty.usbserial 115200

You might need to hit the `enter` key to wake things up, but you should see a regular Linux login prompt.

By default, the console width is 30 characters and wraps on a single line. It's pretty annoying when you paste a long command, so you can increase it for you session with the following

    stty cols 130


When you fire up the `screen` window manager, you can use Ctrl + A (![Option](/images/ks_control.gif) + `A`) to enter "command mode", hitting a subsequent key will execute a command. For example, Ctrl + A follwed by a `?` will show you some helpful commands.

Useful Screen commands.

| Command(s)        | Description
| Kill a session    | `Ctrl + A, Ctrl + \`
