In the [previous post]({{ root_url }}/blog/2012/06/29/getting-things-done-i) in the series, I summarised some of the ideas from David Allen's book [Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0749922648/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=diyfiesta&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0749922648). In this second post, I talk more about trying to apply the basic ideas with more rigour and reflect on how it's working out. I also draw parallels between Allen's ideas and some of the principles that underpin modern agile software development.

## The "Think It Through Principle"

I'd already been using Appigo's [Todo](http://www.appigo.com/todo) app to capture todos against various lists. After reading the first section of the book, one of the first things I did was to delete my custom lists and replace them with Allen's standard set. I removed the spurious `Home`, `Work`, `Other` lists and replaced them with `Inbox`, `Options`, `Reference`, `Someday / Maybe`, `Waiting (for someone)` and `Trash`.

I wanted to apply what I started to think of as the _think it through principle_ to my old items, what Allen calls _front end decisions_. So everything got put back into the global "inbox" until I performed the mental checklist; what is it?; is it actionable?; what's the next action? Things started to get interesting for me here as going through this process, I started to draw parallels between the way Allen talks about _describing, in a single written sentence, the intended successful outcome_ and the agile dictum of identifying acceptance criteria. In both cases, a clear and distinct step is made to clarify intent and recognise when a task is actually _done_.

In _resetting_ my tasks, I also dropped all the dates. I was just ignoring them anyway. I had so many overdue items, they became meaningless. Allen suggests that if an item has a date, then it pretty much _has to get done on that date_, no excuses.


## Next Steps

I liked to movement from "inbox" to say "options". It felt like working up a user story and moving a card on a board when the acceptance criteria had been identified. To solidify this for myself, I try to change the wording of my tasks as they move from the "inbox" to some other list. From a vague, fluffy description to something sounding more like a user story. I'll add a short description if needed.

I also like the idea of the "next steps" part of the _think it through principle_. Getting things out of your mind and into a _trusted_ system feels like it could free up head space; the _trusted_ part being key. Focusing only on the smallest possible next step seems to concentrate the idea. Again, the similarities to the agile principle of _doing to simplest thing possible_ appealed.


Examples,

On receiving my first reminder from HMRC, I filed "Self Assessment 2011/12" into my "stuff" inbox, no date, nothing concrete. Just a label. Almost straight away, I moved it into my "options" list having changed the one line description to be "Pay 2011/12 Self Assessment". The deliberate steps were to pause and turn an _open loop_ into something that I can tick off as done. I came up with the _acceptance criteria_ and gave it a date.

I wasn't clear about the dates though and had a question I wanted to ask my accountant before actually transferring the cash. So my "next step" was to email my accountant. It was going to take less than 2 minutes, so I just fired off a quick mail and moved the item into my "waiting (for someone)" file.

Another example, the _open look_ being to "Improve my blog's SEO" was captured in my inbox. Again, I stopped, thought about the acceptance criteria (what would have to happen for this to be "signed off"), and moved it into the "options" list with no date and a description "add keyword and description metadata to previous articles".

Default date to None
