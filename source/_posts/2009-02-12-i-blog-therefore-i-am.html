Just because I blog, it doesn't mean I'm important. Just because I use commas, it doesn't mean I can grammatically correct others. Just because I use the word 'grammatically', it doesn't mean I can spell. Just becuase I can spell, it doesn't mean I can grammatically correct others spellings.<br /><br />Also, Twitter is shit and exists solely for the purpose of fulfilling its own wet dream.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20485368-1290322762870672514?l=pequenoperro.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
