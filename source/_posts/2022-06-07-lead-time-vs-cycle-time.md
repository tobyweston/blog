The terms _lead time_ and _cycle time_ are often conflated or used interchangeable when in fact there's a subtle distinction. It doesn't help that the terms stem from the manufacturing industry and don't translate directly to software delivery. With the advent of lean manufacturing and the more general adoption of "lean" in the software delivery space, the terms have become more relevant to software delivery. DORA and the [State of DevOps Report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2021.pdf) use **Lead Time for Changes** as one of its four key metrics (and notably don't talk about _cycle time_) and so more and more organisations are becoming interested.

The basic premise is that if you are measuring the duration of manufacturing processes, you can attempt to optimise and use those measurements as feedback. If the duration goes down, you're doing something right. Manufacturing (specifically lean manufacturing) will focus on the _[theory of constraints](https://www.leanproduction.com/theory-of-constraints/)_ and elimination of _waste_ to optimise but any kind of experiment (where the hypothesis is an optimisation of the process) can be validated via this kind of measurement.
