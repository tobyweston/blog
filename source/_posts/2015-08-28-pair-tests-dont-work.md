Either when looking for work or looking to recruit, I've been partaking in pair tests since around 2008. I've only recently come to conclusion that they just don't work. At least not reliably. 

Can you even remeber why you're doing pair tests for recruitment? Is it to see how they "pair"? How they "problem solve"? How they'd be to work with?

The only way to assess these things is actually to do them. Pair tests are a poor simulation. If you want to see how someone pairs, pair with them. Don't pretend to pair with them.

## Full of Contradictions


## From the Interviewer Perspective

If the goal is to see how candidates pair, a pair _test_ in an _interview_ context is just the wrong way to do it. You set things up as a test and however hard you try, it won't be a realistic simulation. You already know the asnwers, so dispite saying "let's try and pair on it and work out the solution together", you're already coming to the table with huge preconceptions and are poised for judegement.


## From the Candidates Perspective

The candidate has a right to understand how it might be working at your company and a pair test gives them very little information. As a candidate I'm terribly nervous, I'm full of doubt and questions about what the interviwers want to see. Should I test drive? 

Candidates are often hyper-sesitive to the interviewrs comments so when an interviewer asks what she considers an inocous question about the exercise, it's all to easy for the candidate to basically freak out. For example;

    Interviewer:            "So why have you used a `val` there and not a `def`."
    Candidates inner voice: "Becuase that's how I like to do it... hang on, I can't say that. They know something I don't know. What is it? WHAT IS IT? Oh, my word, they think I'm an idiot. I *am* an idoit."  

It just comes with the territory. You're at interview. There is a very clear and very deep seated notion of hiarchy, employer/employee at play. Candiates are often expected to want to take a job, even when they know very little about it. Remember, any interview should be a two way process. Am *I* right for the role and is the *role* right for me. It should be a partnership. 

> During my last round of recruitment using pair testing, I made a huge effort to put candidates at ease. We asked candidates to bring code with them to extend and made it clear there is no right or wrong answer. Yet, without exception, all of them showed signs of stress, paniced and basically got them selves into a pickle. 

## Not Everyone Solves Problems the Same Way

When you ask a candidate to solve a problem, however trivial you might think it is, you're basically asking for them to come up with a solution in thrirty seconds. That's not how I work in my day job.


### An Example


## Not Objective

There is often no clear yes or no result to a pair test. Best case scenario: someone flys through the exercise and gets everything "right". Are they an easy hire? Is there more to them? Because of the stressful nature, you can't be sure you're getting the best out of a candidate but people often don't take that into account and assume the simulation for realistic in all meaningful dimensions.

> In my recent round of recruitment, we offered four roles and each of them bsaically messed up the pair test. Each of them paniced or went off in a weird direction in a moment of panic. There's no coming back for the candidate when that happens. I'm hugely proud that we understood things enough to factor in other aspects and still offer on what otherwise would have been seen as a "fail".

## Summary

Pair testing suffers hugely from cognitive bias(?)
