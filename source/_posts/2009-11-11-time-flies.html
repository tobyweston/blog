I've just published tempus-fugit 1.0-SNAPSHOT to <a href="https://maven-repository.dev.java.net/">java.net's public maven repository</a> with a view to synchronising it with Apache's uber-repo. Download <a href="http://download.java.net/maven/2/com/google/code/tempus-fugit/tempus-fugit/1.0-SNAPSHOT/">here</a>, or point your <span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:courier new;">pom</span></span> at it to enjoy all the fanciful goodness inside.<br /><br />oh, I should mention... tempus-fugit represents two things to me<br /><ol><li>A focal point to a lot of thinking done by a lot of very smart people I've been fortunate to work with (along with my own special kind of magic) themed around concurrency and time.</li><li>An attempt to consolidate this thinking into a single place that can be easily reused before finally being discarded with mild disdain*.<br /></li></ol>What it actually is, is<br /><ol><li>a dozen or so classes that capture key abstractions we've found are frequently shared across domains.<br /></li><li>a even smaller number of wrapper or helper classes that we've found can help using concurrency in Java that little bit nicer.</li><li>all with an underlying theme of testing and improving testability.<br /></li></ol>* more specifically, in collaborative projects, it represents a move away from collaboration into a more socially introvert culture whereby collective code ownership becomes uncooperative code ownership. Eat my JAR and don't dare dream of refactoring it. Bad, robot.<br /><br /><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-uMxV_fCbC4/SVInGoVdYJI/AAAAAAAAC08/I4RV1KzCyPo/s320/gibble_22x22.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5283328307719135378" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 22px; height: 22px;" border="0" /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20485368-2809568387746887678?l=pequenoperro.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
