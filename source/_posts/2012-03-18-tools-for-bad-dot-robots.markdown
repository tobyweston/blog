Just a quick post to introduce you to the [robotooling](http://robotooling.com) project,

<!-- more -->

* simple-http; a simple way to build a HTTP client and work with the HTTP verbs. No more lengthy configuration,

* simple-excel; a simple DSL-wrapper over Apache POI to work with sheets
* concordion-ant-task; build [Concordion](http://www.concordion.org/) overview pages for your specifications
* a collection of domain driven design classes so you can quickly incorporate _value types_ and alike in your project.

Head over to [robotooling.com](http://robotooling.com) or [github](https://github.com/tobyweston) to find out
