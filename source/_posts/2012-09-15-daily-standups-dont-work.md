At some point it seems that the standups I've been attended have stopped working. They've certainly  moved away from the original intention to improve collabroation and communication. I'm not sure I can put my finger on why, but I'm not getting much out of them. It's led me to think that standups just don't work. At least in most environments and I'm thinking about what can work in their place.

Some typical problems I see again and again include standups taking too long; standups becoming a tool to chase progress or apply presure and attendees glazing over when it's not their turn to speak. [Jason Yip](http://jchyip.blogspot.co.uk/) talks about some more [common problems](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html#HowDoWeKnowWhenAStand-upIsGoingPoorly).

## It's Not A Status Update

If your standup is more about a status update than collaboration, the rot may have already set in. It's a shame  the first sentance of the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) defines a standup as a "status update". In fact, nearly every page on the subject talks about it in terms of a "status update". Nonesnse.

In my view, it should be about communication and collaboration. The trouble with "status update" is that its all to easy for things to turn into a management update. It's pretty common for team leads, project managers or other stakeholders to coerce the standup into a tool for providing management information. That's what the board is for.

When this becomes a tool to apply pressure or push a project management agenda, things can get pretty negative, pretty fast. Good team leads, managers and stakeholders will use the board for status updates and go round the team individually as they need to. Discussing progress, impediments, clarifying and inspiring. It's all too easy to condense this into an intense experience at standup and those in project management roles have to work hard to preserve the spirit of the standup and pursue management information in another way.

## Communication

So if a standup is really about communication and collaboration, why don't we apply the same principles we apply with Extreme Programming; namely apply it all the time. I'd prefer standups to be more organic. Why not jump up and start a converstaion when you feel like it? Why prescribe a meeting first thing, when you may not have anything to talk about. When you're working in the same physical proximity, it's natural to overhear and contribute to the converstaions around you. Standup, get involved.

The standard [three report items](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/standupmeeting.html) feel a bit arbitary and are intended as a guide not a mantra. I'd go further than that and suggest that even the idea of _reporting_ at standup is the thin end of the wedge. 

Perhaps a better three discussion points are

 1. What's awesome about what you're working on
 1. What's not so awesome
 1. What needs to be escalated.

 ## Collaboration
 
 In the same way, wouldn't it be nice if you pair with whomever, whenever the time is right? Rather than move board avators around in the morning at standup to organising pairs, I prefer to seek an collaborator as I need to and change them often.

## The Good Bits

Of course, none of this may ring true for you.

Even in a dysfunctional standup, I find it useful to start the day with a focusing session. A bit like GTD, what is my immediate next action? Pairing up might also be ...

Some smells to look out for might include when the standup becomes about

## Summary

It's down to individuals in the team to engage. Forcing a standup meeting isn't going to do that. Individuals should be nosey, keeping an eye on the board and the backlog, they don't need to stand infront of the board and watch cards go up or move to the right in the daily standup. They don't need to listen to a synopsis of yesterdays work if they were listening to it unfold yesterday. Management need another forum if they're highjacking your standup and as an engaged individual, it's up to you to champion that change.
