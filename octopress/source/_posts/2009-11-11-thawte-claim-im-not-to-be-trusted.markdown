 ...well, not quite, but they have recently announced that they'd be discontinuing the Personal E-mail Certificates and Web of Trust. These were free services and it comes as bit of a blow as I've been using them to sign my JARs for WebStart deployment. As Thawte are a root authority, it meant no annoying prompts from WebStart claiming I was a would-be terrorist. Looks like I'm back to hiding in shadows.
