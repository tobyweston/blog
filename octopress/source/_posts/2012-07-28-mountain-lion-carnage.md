After installing Mountain Lion, I discovered Java was gone along with Subversion and Git. Even Python was partially crippled. I went through these steps to bring them back.

## Git

On my machine, before the update, Git used to live in

    /usr/bin/git

Which I think was a symbolic link pointing to `/usr/local/git`. This gets wiped out by Mountain Lion, to preserve tools using the old reference (IntelliJ IDEA in my case), I created a new sym link.

    sudo ln -s /usr/local/git/bin/git /usr/bin/git


The `/usr/bin` folder should be on the `$PATH` so it should get the terminal working again too.


## Subversion

[Apparently](http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&p=34790), Apple removed Subversion with 10.8 so there's nothing to do other than install it manually.

You can install Xcode which should put Subversion in `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/svn`. Victor Quinn talks about [reinstalling Xcode](http://victorquinn.com/blog/2012/02/19/fix-git-svn-in-mountain-lion/) to fix similar problems.


## Java

OSX will install this for you the first time you try and start up a Java app. It sets up a symbolic link for `mvn` to point to Maven 3 which may need adjusting if you're still using Maven 2. See [this post]({{ root_url}}/blog/2011/10/29/java-source-on-mac) for the fix.


## Rake / Python

It even managed to mess with my Python installation which gets used when building this blog using the `rake generate` command. Thanks though to [SÃ©bastien Han](http://www.sebastien-han.fr/blog/2012/07/26/broken-rake-after-update-to-mountain-lion/) for getting me out of it.
