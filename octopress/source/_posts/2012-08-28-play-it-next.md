I'm often listening to something on my iPhone whilst thinking about what track to play next. It's a shame the iPod app doesn't let me queue up the next track without interrupting the one that's playing.

I didn't realise how much this bothered me until I found the workaround in the form of the awesome [Play it Next](http://playitnextapp.com/) app. Now I can queue up the next track and get all deejay without breaks in my music. It's like iTunes Up Next feature only for your iPod. I like it so much, I just had to mention it here.

Find it on the [app store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/play-it-next/id549859020?ls=1&mt=8). I definitely recommend it but don't take my word for it, check out the [AppCraver review](http://www.appcraver.com/play-it-next/).
