Yesterday, I released the 1.1 version of my micro-library [tempus-fugit](http://tempusfugitlibrary.org/). From the project's website

> The tempus-fugit library is a small collection of classes and interfaces capturing common abstractions useful when writing concurrent and time sensitive code.

It's now available from the [Maven Central](http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/tempus-fugit/tempus-fugit/)
repository having had a bad experience with [java.net](http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/tempus-fugit/tempus-fugit/)
since their migration (and no longer being able to publish, see this [post](http://java.net/projects/maven-repository/lists/users/archive/2011-03/message/0)
and [another](http://java.net/projects/wagon/lists/users/archive/2011-02/message/0) if you're interested).
