I recently added a basic deadlock detection mechanism to [tempus-fugit](http://tempusfugitlibrary.org/). The [DeadlockDetector](http://tempusfugitlibrary.org/recipes/2012/05/26/detecting-deadlocks/) class allows you to programmatically detect basic deadlocks in your Java code. You can output deadlocks using the following code (note that printing a thread dump using the `ThreadDump` class will automatically attempt to find any deadlocks).

``` java
DeadlockDetector.printDeadlocks(System.out);
```

The `DeadlockDetector` class will spot Java monitor cyclic locking problems and additionally detect `Lock` based cyclic problems. It's implementation is basically the same as that used by `jconsole` and `jstack`. An example is illustrated in the example below.

``` java
@Test
public void potentialDeadlock() {
  new Kidnapper().start();
  new Negotiator().start();
}

public class Kidnapper extends Thread {
  public void run() {
     synchronized (nibbles) {
        synchronized (cash) {
            take(cash);
        }
     }
  }
}

public class Negotiator extends Thread {
  public void run() {
     synchronized (cash) {
        synchronized (nibbles) {
            take(nibbles);
        }
     }
  }
}
```
  
Here, the Kidnapper is unwilling to release poor Nibbles the Cat until he has
the Cash but our Negotiator is unwilling to part with the Cash until he has
poor Nibbles back in his arms. The deadlock detector displays this woeful
situation as follows.

    
      
     Deadlock detected  
     =================  
      
     "Negotiator-Thread-1":  
        waiting to lock Monitor of ...DeadlockDetectorTest$Cat@ce4a8a  
        which is held by "Kidnapper-Thread-0"  
      
     "Kidnapper-Thread-0":  
        waiting to lock Monitor of ...DeadlockDetectorTest$Cash@7fc8b2  
        which is held by "Negotiator-Thread-1"  
    

  
I don't imagine you'll need to print out information about deadlocks or thread
dumps from within your code very often, but on the off chance you'll need to
during debugging, they are both available for you to use in the [tempus-fugit](http://tempusfugitlibrary.org/) project.
