Why didn't Sun add a `value` property to the `@Deprecated` annotation? Instead of
  

``` java
@Documented
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface Deprecated {
}
```

which kind of implies we should do the following.


``` java
@Deprecated
/** @deprecated use {@link Foo} instead */
public class GoneOff {
   // ...
}
```

why can't we have


``` java
@Documented
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface MyDeprecated{
   public abstract String value() default "";
}
```

which means we can use


``` java
@MyDeprecated("use Foo instead")
public class GoneOff {
   // ...
}
```
