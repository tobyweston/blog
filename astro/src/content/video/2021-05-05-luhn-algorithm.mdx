Taken from my course Scala Collections (which is really an all round introduction into Scala), a quick review of the Luhn Algorithm with a typical Java implementation followed by a more Scala-esq version.

I talk briefly about some of the interesting differences between the imperative style and the more functional (programming) approach.

You can find out more about Scala in my [courses on Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/toby-weston)
