How can financial institutions align on software delivery governance without slowing down innovation?

At FINOS OSFF New York 2025, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley introduced the new SDLC Governance Working Group — an open collaboration under FINOS to create a Common Controls Catalogue for software delivery.

Kosli's Mike Long helped form and participates this group, contributing expertise in continuous compliance automation and controls engineering to connect the engineering and policy communities.

Together, these institutions are working to standardize how the financial industry defines, automates, and proves its SDLC controls — turning governance from opinion into evidence.
