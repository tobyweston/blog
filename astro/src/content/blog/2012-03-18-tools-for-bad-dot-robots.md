Just a quick post to introduce the [robotooling](http://robotooling.com) project;
a collection of useful Java tools available for download via the [bad.robot.repo](http://robotooling.com/maven).
Rather than re-implement the same utility code again and again, I've started to collect things under the bad.robot
banner. So far, we have...


* simple-http; a simple way to build a HTTP client and work with the HTTP verbs. No more lengthy configuration,
it just works out of the box.
* simple-excel; a simple DSL-wrapper over Apache POI to work with sheets
* concordion-ant-task; build [Concordion](http://www.concordion.org/) overview pages for your specifications
* a collection of domain driven design classes so you can quickly incorporate _value types_ and alike in your project.

Head over to [robotooling.com](http://robotooling.com) or [github](https://github.com/tobyweston) to find out
more.
