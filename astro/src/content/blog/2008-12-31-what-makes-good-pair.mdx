Communication plays such a big part in what we do, we're always striving to be more expressive in our code, conveying our intent as clearly as possible. It's the same when pairing. We need to be expressive, communicate our intent, engage, listen and feedback. When we don't do these things, pairing just doesn't work. When we don't collaborate, we're not getting as much out of pairing as we could be. Perhaps it's only after working in a good pair that you realise what you're missing working in a bad pairing.
