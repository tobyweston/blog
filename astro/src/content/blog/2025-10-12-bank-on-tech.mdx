Deutsche Bank hosted their annual Bank on Tech event in London, Birmingham, and Dublin today where I was fortunate enough to join Kosli in hosting a panel discussion about compliance.

The event brought together technical experts, thought leaders and innovators, with over 1.9k attendees, various other interactive panel discussions and over 30 community booths showcasing real examples of how technology is enabling business growth.
