I've just published tempus-fugit 1.0-SNAPSHOT to [maven central repository](http://search.maven.org/).

oh, I should mention... tempus-fugit represents two things to me

  1. A focal point to a lot of head scratching around the theme of testing concurrency and time sensitive code.
  1. An attempt to consolidate this thinking into a single place that can be easily reused.

What it actually is, is

  1. a dozen or so classes that capture key abstractions we've found are frequently shared across domains.  
  1. an even smaller number of wrapper or helper classes that we've found can help using concurrency in Java that little bit nicer.
  1. all with an underlying theme of testing and improving testability.
