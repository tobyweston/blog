Master the fundamentals of Scala and understand its emphasis on functional programming that sets it apart from Java. This book will help you translate what you already know in Java to Scala to start your functional programming journey. Learn Scala is split into four parts: a tour of Scala, a comparison between Java and Scala, Scala-specific features and functional programming idioms, and finally a discussion about adopting Scala in existing Java teams and legacy projects.

After reading and using this tutorial, you'll come away with the skills in Scala to kick-start your productivity with this growing popular language.

You will:
* Tour Scala and learn the basic syntax, constructs, and how to use the REPL
* Translate Java syntax that you already know into Scala
* Learn what Scala offers over and above Java
* Become familiar with functional programming concepts and idioms
* Gain tips and advice, useful when transitioning existing Java projects to Scala

## Review

> “The book is written in an accessible style, with numerous examples, and is suitable for a wide range of audiences from novices, just starting to learn how to handle a programming language, to experts trying to get to grips with Scala. The continuous parallel between Scala and Java is used to highlight an interesting angle in both languages, so, technically, the book can be used as a guide to both Java and Scala.” (Irina Ioana Mohorianu, 2018)
