This book is for Java developers looking to transition to programming Scala. It helps translate what you already know in Java to Scala and kick-starts your functional programming journey.

The book takes a tour of Scala to get you up and running then compares Java syntax directly to Scala to give you a quick start translating one-to-one. It goes on to describe Scala specific features including monads and for-comprehensions. The book wraps up with some general advice adopting Scala in Java teams.
