    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There's no reason a unit test can't also be an acceptance test. If you can prove that the <em>unit</em> behaves a certain way <em>and</em> that it production, it will behave in the same way as in your unit test, the intersection should give you enough confidence.</p>

<p>What seems to make things harder to discuss is that its difficult to agree on a common definition for the different types of testing. As a peer-group, we're usually horrified by the previous paragraph and ask the question <em>"shouldn't we start up the entire stack in an acceptance test?"</em>. This often leads us to long-running, duplicative and expensive tests in the name of acceptance testing.</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from Cockburn's <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Hexagonal Architecture</a> and being more flexible in our technical definitions of acceptance testing however, we <em>can</em> create lightning fast acceptance testing.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Conway's Law</h2>

<p>To paraphrase something <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Jazzatola">@Jazzatola</a> recently said</p>

<p><blockquote><p>"people are usually happy to test interactions with other systems 'by specification' but are less happy to do so when testing their internal systems"</p><footer><strong>@Jazzatola</strong> <cite><a href='https://twitter.com/#!/Jazzatola'>twitter.com/#!/Jazzatola/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>As he points out; we're happy to say "given the external system responds with <code>X</code>, when we send a message <code>Y</code> then our system behaves <code>Z</code>". We know the API and test against it as a <em>specification</em>, typically via <em>mocking</em> the behaviour of the external system and testing against the response. We're less happy to talk about our internal interactions as internal APIs in the same way.</p>

<p>I find this interesting for a couple of reasons. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Jazzatola">@Jazzatola</a> was suggesting that this is an example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law">Conway's law</a>; where the communication structures within an organisation are leading design. We're physically separated from our external system actors but intimately acquainted with the internal communication flows. After all, we wrote them.</p>

<p>It's also interesting because it can limit how we go about implementing our acceptance tests.</p>

<h2>Hexagonal Implementation</h2>

<p>If we look at our system as a series of <em>ports</em> and <em>adaptors</em> (as in Cockburn's <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Hexagonal Architecture</a>), we can start to test it as a series of internal, co-operating handoffs. Don't we already test our systems like this; with conventional mocking? The difference is that this kind of mocking is at a finer grained level; we mock <em>collaborators</em> to create unit-style tests and drive out design. When we mock external systems and the <em>ports</em> in our internal systems, we're mocking coarse grained <em>behaviours</em>. We're confirming an established design rather than driving one out. We can formalise this established design as <em>ports</em>.</p>

<p>If you look closely at the last few sentences you'll notice that I'm talking about <em>test confirm</em> at the coarse grained level rather than the <em>test driving</em> techniques we apply with unit-style tests. I think this is natural fit for acceptance testing where we should be thinking about testing the external affects produced by internal flows (more black than white box).</p>

<p>So, given we expect an internal interaction to behave in such-and-such way, why do we need to startup the entire application to exercise the effect of that behaviour? We don't. We can <em>simulate</em> the specification internally by mocking and produce a series of overlapping tests. Each one supporting and giving more confidence to the last.</p>

<p>We've certainly had some great successes with this technique. We've produced faster running test suites that customers were happy to "accept" or sign-off against. We built trust working with the customers to understand the approach and put ourselves more easily in their 'voice' describing the system as a series of internal API interactions.</p>

<h3>Conventional Hexagonal Architecture Footnote</h3>

<p>In the original article, Cockburn talks about ports and adaptors as a fairly abstract architectural approach. He describes it in terms of a pattern which have slightly different motivations than those described here.</p>

<p>He talks about a relatively small number of <em>ports</em> (say ~4-5) and decoupling <em>major</em> components of a system (for example, the database and the GUI) so that it can be driven and tested by different <em>external</em> actors.</p>

<p>I'm talking more about changing the <em>external</em> nature of these actors to be more <em>internal</em>. If we have a much larger number of ports (say >30), decoupling <em>minor</em> components we can achieve this substutatabiliy on a bigger scale and be more flexible on how we test the system.</p>

<p>Conway described an approach where we can test the system at end-to-end via it's ports. Taking this further to confirm small business functionality or <em>acceptance criteria</em> is a logical progression and fits nicely into iterative development.</p>

<p>Have a go and see if it works for you...</p>

    <link href="http://www.baddotrobot.com/blog/2011/06/22/loggin-is-still-evil-but/"/>
    <updated>2011-06-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.baddotrobot.com/blog/2011/06/22/loggin-is-still-evil-but</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://baddotrobot.com/blog/2010/10/18/logging-is-evil-but/">previous post</a>, I was going on about how evil logging is. How it's often confused as a requirement and often badly misused. The upshot of the post was that if you're going to log stuff, in our case using Log4J, lets be honest about it and test it. We should be able to say upfront what's important to log, in what situations and at what log level. Sounds like a straight forward case of test first.</p>

<p>Mocking Log4J however can be a real pain. I've managed it in the past using
Apache's logging abstraction and configuring it to use Log4J under the covers
but in my previous post, I demonstrated a slightly easier way. A helper class
called Log4J that we can use to represent the logging system and that we can
make assertions against. Pretty cool so far.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There was one caveat, I wasn't entirely happy with the fact that the class
would rely on your external Log4J configuration. To assert that a log message
appeared at the level INFO for example, you'd have to make sure that the test
environment sets up the appropriate class to log at that level. It made for a
kind of integration / environmental test which in some cases might be a
sensible test but for the most part, I kept seeing test failures down to
configuration on different environments. Yuk.</p>

<p>So I updated the helper class to include a log level override which will
ignore what the actual configuration says. This means you can write less
brittle tests to say things like "ensure my log message is output at debug
level regardless of the runtime configuration".</p>

<p>The updated class looks like this.</p>

<p>The make assertions like this (which would fail if the matcher fails or

<p>I still think logging is evil and try <em>really</em> hard not to use a single log
statement but if you have to, I hope the helper class helps keep you honest in
your tests ;) Have a look at the <a href="http://baddotrobot.com/blog/2010/10/18/logging-is-evil-but/">previous post</a> for

<p>which is just one example where the exception handling policy for the system
(it's a system-wide concern remember) is muddled at best. Nothing is saying
that the same exception isn't logged elsewhere or that the exception is even
handled correctly or the right people notified. It's not ok to just log and
rethrow and every single time we go to declare a new logger, we should think
twice.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We've taken this very literally in my current project and everyone is actively
discouraged from instantiating a logger. I'd rather be explicit that some
exception event has occurred and fire an event that some interested party can
listen for. This makes perfect sense when you think about the huge log files
that someone has to trawl through, armed only with for some vague clue as to
what went wrong, a grep manual and the futile hope that developers actually
log something useful. All without the context of the code to actually guide
them. Good luck.</p>

<p>The disseminated log problem is exacerbated if there is no clear audit trail
tying pieces of information together. In a system with thousands of request
per second, how do you tie the logged request inputs to some stack trace
embedded in the middle of another thousand requests? What should have been a
clear set of requirements from the business (in this case, presumably the
support team) can easily get lost in the technical translation.</p>

<blockquote><p>Logging is evil, but if I really <em>have</em> to log, be honest about it...</p></blockquote>

<p>Asking the business <em>"what information do you want to see in the event of x
happening"</em> rather than assuming they want to see some stack trace in a huge
log can make a lot of sense. We're often not logging for ourselves (we have
debuggers for that), we're often logging for our customers. If we start to
think about this stuff early, in terms of exception events and their audience,
we can build systems that tell the outside world something meaningful in
flexible ways. We start to define a system wide exception handling policy
rather than relying of the default exception handler (<code>System.out</code> is rarely
the right choice!).</p>

<p>So back to my current project... people are regularly beaten with a chair leg
for creating loggers but I'll admit that on occasion, I've actually logged
stuff and didn't resort to some Opus Dei style self-flagellation. Logging is
evil, but if I really <em>have</em> to log, my saving grace is to be explicit about
it. I'll hunt down a customer and I'll write a test to advertise the fact the
log contains what they asked for.</p>

<p>Most of the common logging frameworks make it troublesome to inject a logger
instance, and I'm reluctant to subvert behaviour just because some logging
framework wants me to. Logging (or preferably, firing an event) should be
orthogonal to the classes core behaviour, why should I compromise? My
preferred approach is the canonical example of using Aspects, or less
esoterically, using decorators.</p>

<p>For example, I created a interface to handle HTTP POST requests, imaginatively
called <code>Post</code>. Why should I add logging to implementations and open the door
to ad-hoc, erratic logging? I shouldn't, but when my implementation
<code>CustomerPost</code> requires logging of the request and response, I can decorate
with a <code>LoggingPost</code></p>

<p>You might be concerned that the try/catch above looks very similar to the
original negative example. The good thing about our decorated example above is
that by being explicit about this classes responsibility, declaring the usage
in the correct context, we can actually define the system wide policy for
logging the <code>Post</code> calls in one place, without affecting the contract of the
interface. We'd do this for example, on the system boundary, for example where
the RESTful API is implemented.</p>

<p>In our <code>LoggingPost</code> above, we haven't even tried to inject a logger in to
make the testing easier. Instead, mostly because I was being lazy, I used the
helper class below. This is intended to represent Log4J in the context of a
test and give access to the logger for assertion purposes.</p>

<p>It relies on nasty statics to dynamically add a logger to Log4J's list of
loggers and thereby appending any generated logs to something that the <code>Log4J</code>
test helper can assert on. I can't decide if I like this or not. It gives you
an extra test that your class under test is using a logger with the name that
you expect (<code>"Post.class"</code> in the example above), testing your logger
configuration as a by-product.</p>

<p>What I found interesting about this though was that it was always seemed a lot
of effort making some logging framework play nicely with mocks, or writing and
configuring a custom in memory appender and asserting on it. With the above
example, I very quickly added confirmation to existing Log4J infrastructure.
It seemed almost too easy... so I'd love to hear your comments and how you
write tests for logging.</p>

<p>PS. Logging is evil.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good poker players know when to change gears. They know when to alter their playing style from cautious to aggressive as the game changes and players drop out. They look at how the <em>odds change</em> as the game progresses and react appropriately. It's the same with testing, you gotta know when to change gears.</p>

<p>To put it development terms, good developers know when to change gears. They
know when to change their testing style from cautious to aggressive as the
code evolves.</p>

<p>Lets pretend there is just three types of testing; unit, integration and
acceptance. In the interest of stereotyping, we'll define them simplistically
as</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Unit</em> - single object tests, no collaborations (strict I know, but bear with me)</li>
<li><em>Integration</em> - testing object collaborations, for the purposes of this article, lets assume end-to-end testing slot into this bracket</li>
<li><em>Acceptance</em> - leaning towards end-to-end but key here is that they are customer authored. As such, to convince the customer these will likely be relatively coarse grained and start outside the system boundary</li>
</ul>

<h3>Starting in a low gear with unit tests</h3>

<p>People are probably most comfortable with this type of testing. The term unit
testing and the technology JUnit have become so intertwined in the Java world,
that people often confuse tests written with JUnit as unit tests. They may be,
but they may not be. So where's the value in defining the term unit testing
and how does knowing what type of test you've just written in JUnit help with
changing gears?</p>

<p>Knowing what gear you're in and knowing the terrain that’s coming up is
essential for you to select the right gear. Writing a non-unit test in JUnit
has value, of course it does (assuming it actually tests something) so why
should I care if it’s a unit test or a chazzwazzer? Knowing where you are and
where you want to be is useful because you can defer some things and avoid
duplication. So for me, unit testing is good for testing the edge cases (Right
BICEP) and exploring the class you're writing. It can be especially useful
when you <em>test drive</em> towards something or explore relationships and your
understanding of the classes roles and responsibilities. In this sense,
testing becomes a design activity or an analysis activity, a chance to phrase
your thinking and understanding in code. The regression element can quickly
lose value here. For example, writing a test with mocks to explore the
interaction between two collaborators, A and B. Then writing a separate test
to explore the same for classes B and C. Then a test for A, B and C. There was
value in each test individually, but is there still value in all three when
there is obvious cross-over? When might I consciously choose <em>not</em> to write
unit tests?</p>

<h3>Changing up to integration tests</h3>

<p>If I know the context that a set of objects are going to work together in, I'm
going to want to be confident that they work together as expected. I can't
test these in isolation, so I'm going to need to test them in cooperation. At
this level, my confidence is fairly high around the composites so I'm already
up and running, I'm more concerned here with a broader brush approach. I'm
certainly not interested in re-testing all the lower level object tests, just
how they operate together. So I change up a gear and as a developer, convince
myself that these object work together <em>in context</em>. I'm most likely still
using JUnit but I understand what gear I'm in.</p>

<h3>Cruising with acceptance tests</h3>

<p>So how about the value to the business? The unit tests in particular don't
advertise value to the business, they're a developer tool and its all too easy
to write individual classes well with good test coverage and yet combine them
into something that doesn't work. Demonstrating to business that their
specifications have been meet is the ultimate gear, and to change up to that
gear and have overall confidence in the system means going through the
previous gears to get there. Knowing that you'll be changing up whilst in
lower gears can help you decide what to do in those lower gears.</p>

<p>For example, lets assume the business want to <em>see</em> the affect of a
configuration file in the system. When developing the code to load and decode
the contents of the file, you started by proving the component works at the
unit level so why would you test that the component is wired up correctly as a
unit test? You'd be forced to mock that component in some higher level
component and test it calls it. But what does this give you? You can still
wire the higher level component up incorrectly. The acceptance test is going
to have to test this to demonstrate the affect, so there's an argument to say
you can leave it to the acceptance test to verify. This might have the added
bonus of avoiding "breaking up" the higher level component albeit a minor
point.</p>

<h3>The missing gear?</h3>

<p>When we build software in a componentised way, we're often left with objects
that work in isolation with their dependencies passed in. We push up and up
the assembly of the objects and their ultimate iterations and are left with
parts of the system that are responsible for this assembly. This might be
done in code or by some dependency injection framework. Either way,
it feels like these 'assemblers' have a clear role
and responsibility and so shouldn't they be tested? What gear do we test them
in? Personally, I'm comfortable in limiting the assembly options and so reduce
the combinations of testing required. With a single "builder" or "spring
context", I'm comfortable with testing these through acceptance tests.</p>

<p>In this article, I suppose I'm using "gears" as an analogy for pragmatism and
certainly not pace. I'm not saying that good developers know when to rush,
compromising quality but they do know how to optimise their testing
strategies. I think its important not to get bogged down in exhaustive unit-
style testing if its not of value and so understanding what gear you're in and
what gear you'll soon be in can help focus your attentions. What to test and
when is the question I find myself asking again and again.</p>
