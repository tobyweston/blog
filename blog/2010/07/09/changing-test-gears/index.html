<div class="entry-content"><p>Good poker players know when to change gears. They know when to alter their playing style from cautious to aggressive as the game changes and players drop out. They look at how the <em>odds change</em> as the game progresses and react appropriately. It&#8217;s the same with testing, you gotta know when to change gears.</p>

<p>To put it development terms, good developers know when to change gears. They
know when to change their testing style from cautious to aggressive as the
code evolves.</p>

<p>Lets pretend there is just three types of testing; unit, integration and
acceptance. In the interest of stereotyping, we&#8217;ll define them simplistically
as</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Unit</em> - single object tests, no collaborations (strict I know, but bear with me)</li>
<li><em>Integration</em> - testing object collaborations, for the purposes of this article, lets assume end-to-end testing slot into this bracket</li>
<li><em>Acceptance</em> - leaning towards end-to-end but key here is that they are customer authored. As such, to convince the customer these will likely be relatively coarse grained and start outside the system boundary</li>
</ul>

<h3>Starting in a low gear with unit tests</h3>

<p>People are probably most comfortable with this type of testing. The term unit
testing and the technology JUnit have become so intertwined in the Java world,
that people often confuse tests written with JUnit as unit tests. They may be,
but they may not be. So where&#8217;s the value in defining the term unit testing
and how does knowing what type of test you&#8217;ve just written in JUnit help with
changing gears?</p>

<p>Knowing what gear you&#8217;re in and knowing the terrain that’s coming up is
essential for you to select the right gear. Writing a non-unit test in JUnit
has value, of course it does (assuming it actually tests something) so why
should I care if it’s a unit test or a chazzwazzer? Knowing where you are and
where you want to be is useful because you can defer some things and avoid
duplication. So for me, unit testing is good for testing the edge cases (Right
BICEP) and exploring the class you&#8217;re writing. It can be especially useful
when you <em>test drive</em> towards something or explore relationships and your
understanding of the classes roles and responsibilities. In this sense,
testing becomes a design activity or an analysis activity, a chance to phrase
your thinking and understanding in code. The regression element can quickly
lose value here. For example, writing a test with mocks to explore the
interaction between two collaborators, A and B. Then writing a separate test
to explore the same for classes B and C. Then a test for A, B and C. There was
value in each test individually, but is there still value in all three when
there is obvious cross-over? When might I consciously choose <em>not</em> to write
unit tests?</p>

<h3>Changing up to integration tests</h3>

<p>If I know the context that a set of objects are going to work together in, I&#8217;m
going to want to be confident that they work together as expected. I can&#8217;t
test these in isolation, so I&#8217;m going to need to test them in cooperation. At
this level, my confidence is fairly high around the composites so I&#8217;m already
up and running, I&#8217;m more concerned here with a broader brush approach. I&#8217;m
certainly not interested in re-testing all the lower level object tests, just
how they operate together. So I change up a gear and as a developer, convince
myself that these object work together <em>in context</em>. I&#8217;m most likely still
using JUnit but I understand what gear I&#8217;m in.</p>

<h3>Cruising with acceptance tests</h3>

<p>So how about the value to the business? The unit tests in particular don&#8217;t
advertise value to the business, they&#8217;re a developer tool and its all too easy
to write individual classes well with good test coverage and yet combine them
into something that doesn&#8217;t work. Demonstrating to business that their
specifications have been meet is the ultimate gear, and to change up to that
gear and have overall confidence in the system means going through the
previous gears to get there. Knowing that you&#8217;ll be changing up whilst in
lower gears can help you decide what to do in those lower gears.</p>

<p>For example, lets assume the business want to <em>see</em> the affect of a
configuration file in the system. When developing the code to load and decode
the contents of the file, you started by proving the component works at the
unit level so why would you test that the component is wired up correctly as a
unit test? You&#8217;d be forced to mock that component in some higher level
component and test it calls it. But what does this give you? You can still
wire the higher level component up incorrectly. The acceptance test is going
to have to test this to demonstrate the affect, so there&#8217;s an argument to say
you can leave it to the acceptance test to verify. This might have the added
bonus of avoiding &#8220;breaking up&#8221; the higher level component albeit a minor
point.</p>

<h3>The missing gear?</h3>

<p>When we build software in a componentised way, we&#8217;re often left with objects
that work in isolation with their dependencies passed in. We push up and up
the assembly of the objects and their ultimate iterations and are left with
parts of the system that are responsible for this assembly. This might be
done in code or by some dependency injection framework. Either way,
it feels like these &#8216;assemblers&#8217; have a clear role
and responsibility and so shouldn&#8217;t they be tested? What gear do we test them
in? Personally, I&#8217;m comfortable in limiting the assembly options and so reduce
the combinations of testing required. With a single &#8220;builder&#8221; or &#8220;spring
context&#8221;, I&#8217;m comfortable with testing these through acceptance tests.</p>

<p>In this article, I suppose I&#8217;m using &#8220;gears&#8221; as an analogy for pragmatism and
certainly not pace. I&#8217;m not saying that good developers know when to rush,
compromising quality but they do know how to optimise their testing
strategies. I think its important not to get bogged down in exhaustive unit-
style testing if its not of value and so understanding what gear you&#8217;re in and
what gear you&#8217;ll soon be in can help focus your attentions. What to test and
when is the question I find myself asking again and again.</p>
